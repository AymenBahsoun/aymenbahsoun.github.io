[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://ralobos.github.io/files/CV_RLOBOS_NOV2021.pdf)

I'm a final-year PhD student working under the guidance of Professor Justin P. Haldar in the Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG) at the University of Southern California (USC). My research interests include signal and image processing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational imaging, inverse problems, and the connections between machine learning and constrained image reconstruction.
