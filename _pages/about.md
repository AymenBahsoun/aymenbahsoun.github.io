[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://aymenbahsoun.github.io/files/aymenbahsoun.pdf)

I'm a postdoctoral research fellow working under the guidance of Dr. Hero Hussain at the Michigan Institute of Imaging Technology and Translation (MIITT) at the University of Michigan. I completed my Bachelor's in Medical Imaging Sciences in 2019, and then my M.D. at the American Unviersity of Beirut in 2023. I am hoping to pursue a residency in Radiology.  My research interests include: Hepatocellular carcinoma & liver imaging and their prognostic factors, bladder and prostate magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) to characterize lower urinary tract symptoms, low field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for several clinical applications, particularly abdominal pathologies.
