[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://r-a-lobos.github.io/rmi/files/CV_RLOBOS_jan2021.pdf)

I am a 5th year PhD student working under the guidance of Professor Justin P. Haldar in the Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG) at the University of Southern California (USC). My research interests include signal processing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational imaging, inverse problems, and the connections between machine learning and constrained image reconstruction.
